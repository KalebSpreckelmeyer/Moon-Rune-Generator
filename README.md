The Moon Rune Generator
=======================

Description: 
------------

> This small application generates a random message based on a set of arrays of strings. It choses a random amount of "parts" to have in each message, randomly choses which array it will select from, then choses a string from it at random. The result is a garbled unintelligble mess. Exactly as I envisioned it. 

Features:
------------
- Creates a random message from a set of arrays

How to Use:
------------
- Set the maximum amount of "parts" to a message by setting the maxParts value on line 11.

- Add more message components by adding to the arrays on the top few lines, or add an entirely new array. It's designed to be scalable in that regard.

- Run the program by clicking "run and debug" with node.js

Technologies Used:
------------

- JavaScript
